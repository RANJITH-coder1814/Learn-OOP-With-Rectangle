# Rectangle Area and Perimeter in C++

This repository contains a basic C++ program that demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using a `Rectangle` class. The program calculates the **area** and **perimeter** of a rectangle using class objects.

## 📌 Features
- Simple `Rectangle` class
- Calculates area and perimeter
- Beginner-friendly example
- Uses basic C++ OOP concepts

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Classes and Objects
- Member Functions
- Basic input/output (`cout`)
- C++ syntax fundamentals

## 🧾 Code Overview
The `Rectangle` class includes:
- Data members: `length`, `breadth`
- Member functions:
  - `area()` – returns area of the rectangle
  - `perimeter()` – returns perimeter of the rectangle

In `main()`, an object of `Rectangle` is created and used to display results.

## ▶️ How to Compile and Run
1. Save the file as `rectangle.cpp`
2. Compile:
   ```bash
   g++ rectangle.cpp -o rectangle
